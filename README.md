# Pacman: An implementation example.

This is an simple example that shows how to program graphic games with sprite
animations, controlable characters, automatic characters, message sending and
screen scrolling.

You may define your own map in a text file (see examples inside Text_Files). In
order to load your own map you must edit the file current_map.txt and write
your file name. You must edit sprites.txt in order to specify where pacman and
ghosts will appear.

System requeriments:

- GNU/Linux Operating System
- Qt5

FIXME list:
- Screen scrolling is not working when map is smaller than canvas.
